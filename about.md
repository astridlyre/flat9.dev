I am a self-taught developer and Linux enthusiast. When I am not learning more about
coding and technology, I like to play guitar and take photos. I have worked for several
years as a professional guitarist, performing on cruise ships with [Royal
Caribbean](https://www.royalcaribbean.com/), working in musical theatre productions in the
Vancouver area at the [Chemainus Theatre](https://chemainustheatrefestival.ca/), and I
have performed around the world in the tiniest of clubs and at various music festivals.

Some of my favourite musicians and influences are [Julian Lage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8a3qAp81vY8),
[Nelson Veras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAaaG8hUdgA), Debussy, JS Bach and Chopin.

I post pictures on my
[instagram](https://www.instagram.com/artsyidler) under the pseudonym "artsyidler". My
favourite types of photography are portraiture and street photography. I am influenced by
the work of Sebasti√£o Salgado, Fan Ho, and of course Henri Cartier-Bresson.

When it comes to coding, I have been learning primarily JavaScript and Go, but Linux has
always appealed to me and I am excited to delve deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole
that is modal editing and bash scripting! I have recently put my [dotfiles](https://gitlab.com/ebflat9/dotfiles) up on GitLab.
